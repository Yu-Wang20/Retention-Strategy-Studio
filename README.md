# Lifecycle Strategy Engine\n\nA production-grade SaaS demo for customer lifecycle analytics and retention strategy design. This platform walks through the entire lifecycle management loop: RFM segmentation → churn prediction → strategy simulation → A/B test design → explainability → documented metric definitions.\n\n## Live Demo\n\nA live demonstration of the platform is available at [https://lifecycleengine-83zeab8g.manus.space](https://lifecycleengine-83zeab8g.manus.space).\n\n## Purpose\n\nModern growth and CRM teams struggle to convert raw customer data into actionable retention strategies. Metrics are often defined inconsistently, insights are disconnected from activation workflows, and machine‑learning models are opaque. The Lifecycle Strategy Engine addresses these challenges by pairing robust analytics with a credibility layer and a clear action loop.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- **Dashboard** – High‑level KPIs such as gross merchandise value (GMV), active customers, churn rate and average order value. Time‑series charts and segment distribution give a holistic view of the business.\n\n- **Data Management** – Ingest transactional tables (e.g., customers, orders, payments, reviews) and define derived metrics and windows. The metrics dictionary records auditable definitions, filters and deduplication keys.\n\n- **RFM Analysis** – Segment customers by recency, frequency and monetary value. Export segment lists for operational targeting and view strategy playbooks at the segment level.\n\n- **Churn Prediction** – Train and evaluate a churn model with AUC/precision/recall metrics. Review calibration curves and global feature importance (SHAP) and open a per‑customer explanation drawer to understand drivers of risk. High‑risk customer lists include action call‑to‑actions and retraining triggers.\n\n- **Strategy Engine** – Simulate promotions with configurable budgets and discounts to estimate incremental revenue and retained users. Visualize diminishing returns with marginal ROI curves. Design A/B tests with sample size calculators and monitor active experiments. Export user‑level target lists with recommended offers and expected uplift. A webhook simulator previews payloads and logs success/failure to close the activation loop.\n\n- **Documentation & Credibility Layer** – A built‑in metrics dictionary and data lineage view ensure metrics are trustworthy. The app distinguishes between mock data and real aggregates and provides transparency into how metrics feed models and dashboards.\n\n## Problems Solved\n\n- **Metric Ambiguity** – Provides standardized definitions for GMV, AOV, churn and other metrics across teams.\n\n- **Lack of Action Loop** – Integrates segment exports, experiment design and webhook triggers to tie insights directly to activation.\n\n- **Black‑Box Models** – Exposes model performance and SHAP‑based explanations so stakeholders understand why a user is high‑risk and why a particular offer is recommended.\n\nBy combining analytics, predictive modelling and strategy design in one interface, the Lifecycle Strategy Engine serves as a credible example of how to operationalize customer lifecycle management.\n\n## Tech Stack\n\n- Front‑end: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS\n- Back‑end: FastAPI / Node (depending on implementation)\n- Database: PostgreSQL / SQLite\n- Modelling: Python (scikit‑learn), SHAP\n- Deployment: Docker + cloud hosting
